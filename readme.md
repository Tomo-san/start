Just clone the repo, run `npm install` for dependencies and then `grunt`to compile.

Edit sites via [sites.js](https://github.com/Tomo-san/start/blob/master/src/js/sites.js). It should be fairly easy to understand. The sites are split into Groups so each group has a name, inside a group you'll have links. Each link has a url and text that is displayed on the site.

Will work on it a bit more as everything can always be improved.
