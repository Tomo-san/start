# Start
## A React based Start Page for your web browser.

### Getting Started

You'll need [Node](http://nodejs.org/) & [Webpack](http://gruntjs.com/) for this!

Just clone the repo and run `npm install` for dependencies.

Next edit the data by renaming `_config.js` to `config.js` and then edit this file. It should be fairly easy to understand. The sites are split into Groups so each group has a name, inside a group you'll have links. Each link has a url and text that is displayed on the site.

Once you've editied config.js as you want, run `webpack` in the root of the project to build the css/js.
