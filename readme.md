### Getting Started

You'll need [Node](http://nodejs.org/) & [Webpack](http://gruntjs.com/) for this!

Just clone the repo and run `npm install` for dependencies.

Next edit the data by renaming `_config.js` to `config.js` and then edit this file. It should be fairly easy to understand. The sites are split into Groups so each group has a name, inside a group you'll have links. Each link has a url and text that is displayed on the site. You'll also need to 

To edit the markup of the site, edit `src/index.html` NOT `index.html`. The root file will be overwritten on every `grunt`. To edit the design just edit `site.less`.

##### Remember to run `grunt` after every change!

### Designs
