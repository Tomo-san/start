Just clone the repo, run `npm install` for dependencies and then `grunt`to compile.

Edit sites via [sites.js](https://github.com/Tomo-san/start/blob/master/src/js/site.js). I split them up into categories to give them separate rows but it's up to you I guess.

Will work on it a bit more as everything can always be improved.
